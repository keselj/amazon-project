# Amazon Project

Welcome to the Amazon Project! This project simulates a simple version of an Amazon-like e-commerce website. In this project, we have been provided with some of the HTML and CSS code, and you have implemented JavaScript to handle dynamic product rendering and cart management. Let's dive into the details of the project.

## Project Overview

The Amazon Project consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file provides the basic structure of the web page, while the CSS file handles the styling and appearance. The JavaScript file dynamically renders product items and manages the shopping cart functionality.

### Project Files

The project comprises three main files: `index.html`, `amazon.css`, and `amazon.js`.

#### `index.html`

This file serves as the main web page for the Amazon Project. It includes the following sections and elements:

- An Amazon header section containing the logo, search bar, and cart icon with quantity indicator.
- The main product grid section, which will be populated dynamically using JavaScript.
- The necessary links to CSS and JavaScript files.

#### `amazon.css`

The CSS file provides styling for the Amazon Project. It includes styles for the Amazon header, search bar, cart icon, product grid, and other relevant elements.

#### `amazon.js`

The JavaScript file contains the functionality for the Amazon Project. It handles the following tasks:

1. Dynamically renders product items: The script loops through the `products` array and generates HTML elements for each product, including the product image, name, rating, price, quantity selector, and add-to-cart button.

2. Manages the shopping cart: The script adds event listeners to each "Add to Cart" button. When a button is clicked, the corresponding product is added to the cart. The script also updates the cart quantity indicator in the header.

3. Displays a confirmation message: When a product is added to the cart, a confirmation message briefly appears below the product, indicating that it has been added.

## Getting Started

To see the Amazon Project in action, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will find the Amazon header, product grid, and an option to add products to the cart.

## Conclusion

A basic e-commerce website that showcases dynamic product rendering and cart management. Feel free to enhance the project further by adding additional features, implementing backend functionality, or improving the user interface. Happy coding!
